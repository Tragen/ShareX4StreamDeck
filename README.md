# ShareX4StreamDeck

ShareX4StreamDeck is a Stream Deck plugin which adds buttons for interaction with ShareX. There are currently 3 actions:

- Screenshot
- Screen Record
- Workflow

## Screenshot & Screen Record

These actions are super simple, just drag in the action, then in the drop down, choose what you would like to screenshot/screen record.

## Workflow

Adding workflows is as simple as typing the name of the workflow. Workflows can be added in the Hotkey settings in ShareX.

**WORKFLOWS ARE CASE SENSITIVE**

If nothing happens or the current window switches to ShareX when trying to use your Workflow, check the spelling and capitalization.
